## Population in NYC and DM
To begin, we took a look at the population between New York City (NYC) and Des Moines (DM). New York City has an estimated population of about 8.3 million while Des Moines has a population of about 214 hundred thousand. Upon first glance, it may seem that the drastic difference in population size makes it seem that Des Moines would not be conducive area to start a bike-sharing business. However, if you breakdown the population by gender, you see that NYC and DM have roughly the same gender ratios. The pie chart titled "Bicycle Renters In NYC" shows that the majority of bike renters are male. From this we can assume that a similar renting pattern would occur in Des Moines, where men would consist of the greatest portion of renters.

## Bike Rental 
The "Customer" pie chart shows us that the majority of bike customers in NYC are subscribers. This is an interesting demographic to look at because normally we think of NYC as the hub for tourism. However, the pie chart tells us otherwise. In addition, if we look at the type of bike users in the "August Peak Hours" graph, we can once again see that the majority of users are in fact locals. This is a promising finding because it means that Des Moines would not have to rely solely its tourism to make the bike-sharing business profitable. 

## Tourism in Des Moines 
That being said, the Greater Des Moines area has an official tourism marketing organization called Catch Des Moines. They provide tourists and locals with a visitiors guide that provides a listings of popular neighborhoods and general insight into what activites are available. We can look through the guide to see that there is a map that highlights the popular neighborhoods. We can use this map to detemine where to place bike renting stations.

## McDonalds in DM and NYC
If we compare the map provided in the visitors guide to the map of McDonalds locations in DM, we can see that there is at least one McDonalds located in each of the popular neighborhoods. In addition, if we compare the map of McDonalds in NYC to the Top Ending Locations of bike rentals in NYC, we can see that there is a congregation of McDonalds in the same location as where a majority of bike-sharers end their journey. 

## Weather
Some might ask, well what other factors may affect bike-rental? One factor that I thought of was weather. I went ahead and compared the weather of NYC and DM in August. Both cities have similar temperatures in August. And if there is a lot of bike-renting-traffic in NYC in August weather, we can safely assume that locals and tourists will be inclined to do the same in DM.

## Conclusion
Des Moines is a perfect area to start a bike-sharing business. They have a strong origanization that promotes activites within the area for both tourists and locals. Des Moines has wonderful weather in the summer months. And if the bicycle renting locations are placed in strategic locations, I believe that investors would see a thriving business.
